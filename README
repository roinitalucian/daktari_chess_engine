Daktari Chess Engine
an XBoard engine

Roinita Lucian-Teodor 325CA
Calin Dragos-Stefan 325CA
Mitrofan Laurentiu-Marian 325CA




How to use:

	- place the engine directory inside the xboard directory.
	- open the engine directory.
	- make build - to compile the program.
	- make run - to run xboard with the engine loaded.




Project Structure:

	- main.cpp - starts the program and calls the start_game() function.
	- engine.cpp - contains the main loop of the game.
	- utils.cpp - functions that do not influence the game flow directly,
	but are used inside the main ones.
	- headers that contain all the functions' declarations.





Algorithmic approach:

	PHASE 1

		We did not implement strategy algorithms so far. The only things
	we did were representing the table and pieces internally, writing the
	main functions of the program and communicating with XBoard.
		We chose to represent the chess board as a 12x12 matrix, instead
	of a classic 8x8, to avoid future problems with pieces running off
	the board. Thus, there is a 2 box sized rim around the board.
		The pieces are integers. We used positive numbers for the engine
	pieces and negative numbers for the opponent's ones.
		The most important functions is search_legal_moves(), that iterates
	through all the pieces on the board and finds the possible moves for
	each of them. So far it works for pawns only, but we will add the rest
	soon.

Responsibilities:

	- Roinita Lucian: started the project and implemented the main features
	of the engine.
	- Calin Dragos: implemented some commands and fixed several problems
	of the program.
	- Mitrofan Laurentiu: fixed multiple errors and helped with the general
	flow of the program.
